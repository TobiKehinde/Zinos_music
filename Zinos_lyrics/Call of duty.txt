Oya, oya, drink
Drink garri whether ya brain go come down
I dey smoke Igbo
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Niphkeys

[Verse 1]
I be person pikin, I get feelings too
My mind is split in two, I love you but I love Simbi too
Girl you can just tell me if you want Jimmy Choo
See me, God I knew it too
So many other guys wan chill with you

[Chorus]
Now I just want to marry her
Wan buy her designer
Check your window, ka ri ra
It's been like four days, ta ri ra
I don upgrade, my terminal
Two shorties, ma pami na
You know say me I sabi na
Her song is sweet like Ribena
Mummy and daddy njo, boy and girls njo
Omode pe'lagbalagba, oloyun ton lo s'antenatal
Anywhere me I go, say dem love my flow
Dem say Zino get lamba, omode wey get raba, ahn

I be inside playing call of duty
Loving you be my call of duty
Say for loving too I am guilty

[Bridge]
She think all I want is sex, and it doesn't make her upset
Girl you have to bring your friends 'cause they all have to meet my friends
And we have a show by ten, so we have to leave by then
Who I be?, dem no get idea, "cause I no dey too show myself

[Chorus]
Now I just want to marry her
Wan buy her designer
Check your window, ka ri ra
It's been like four days, ta ri ra
I done upgrade, my stamina
Two shorties, ma pami na
You know say me I sabi na
My song is sweet like Ribena
Mummy and daddy njo, boy and girls njo
Omode pe'lagbalagba, oloyun ton lo s'antenatal
Anywhere me I go, say dem love my flow
Dem say Zino get lamba, omode wey get raba, ahn

Me I no fit give up on you

Baby ma bami ja
[Outro]
I be inside playing call of duty
Loving you be my call of duty
Say for loving too I am guilty
