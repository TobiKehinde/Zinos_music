[Verse 1]
I left dem post on my Instagram
So, you can see there was a turnin' point
There is no method or diagram
Omo ogbon, shebi you know where I was
Comin' from?

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, look at me, I've gone far
Dem no know when I run pass
More money, more respect
Give them what they don't expect
Now, look at me, I've gone far
Dem no know when I run pass
More money, more respect
Give them what they don't expect

[Chorus]
Ma fowo kan mi oh, ma shey be
Ma fowo kan mi oh, ma shey be
Ma fowo kan mi oh, ma shey be
Ma fowo kan mi oh, ma shey be-e
Ma f'owo kan mi oh, ma shey be
Ma fowo kan mi oh, ma shey be
Ma fowo kan mi oh, ma shey be
Ma f'owo kan mi oh, ma shey be-e

Look at this nigga callin' me "rascal", Ore, you
When you was on Insta' causin' disaster
Don't know why they feel like me lowe dem
I get pepper, me go show dem
Me, I know my people remember
Dem know how we do it every December
