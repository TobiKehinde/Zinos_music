[Verse 1]
She say you be my man
And then I'll be your woman
I'm very willing, I'm ready to be your dad
You take me places

This love is crazy shey you wan testing meter

[Pre-Chorus]
So I swear
Anything you want I go do oh
Say your love turn me to mumu oh
Tell me what them haters gon' do oh ?
No Idea

They just want to know our lifestyle
For your love I no get control oh

And I will be your woman everyday
You be my man

Ah, Ye
See I keep loving you everyday
I might be high but not today
E no hit anywhere
It's me and you against the world anyway
Even inside the rain
We go go all the way
Hmmm, cos it's nice to see the rainbow
Anytime the rain goes
Showed you to my day ones and they all like you

[Pre-Chorus]
So I swear
Anything you want I go do oh
Say your love turn me to mumu oh
Tell me what them haters gon' do oh ?
No Idea
Them no get password to the WiFi
They just want to know our lifestyle
For your love I no get control oh

[Chorus]
You be my man
And I will be your woman everyday
You be my man
And I will be your woman everyday
