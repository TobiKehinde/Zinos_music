5 ContributorsMany Things Lyrics[Verse 1]
Mama said, "You don't need no interception, you are perfect
Because of your imperfection"
Anywhere any direction where you go say
"Never beg for no affection"
Melo melo ni mo fe so
In the tension dem won put me under pressure
Won fe gbo nkan ti mo fe so
But now I got people waiting for my next song

[Pre-Chorus]
Something just dey tell me ride on
No be say na me do pass
Baba just decide to gimme through pass
E look my life and gimme two chance
And as omo ogbon mo ride won
But still I no too gas
I no dey go to church but I no do jazz
Now you see I'm living good life

[Chorus]
'Cause many many things
Many many things
I know say I small but my eyes don see
Many many things, many many things
Be like I cross seven mountains and seven seas
I still dey insist oga I no dey resist
Me I don hustle now d cash no contain my jeans
But no be so e be yesterday
No be so e be yesterday

Life go teach you pass professor
On d road so no ask me where I learned from
Always moving with precaution
Mehn I swear say you no fit catch me for junction
Ever since I dropped my first song me I know say
The next one go be d best one
Kemi gan to damo tan so mehn
Eye too see melo ni mo fe so

[Pre-Chorus]
Something just dey tell me ride on
No be say na me do pass
Baba just decide to gimme through pass
E look my life and gimme two chance
And as omo ogbon mo ride won
But still I no too gas
I no dey go to Church but I no do jazz
Now you see I'm living good life

[Chorus]
'Cause many many things
Many many things
I know say I small but my eyes don see
Many many things
Many many things
Be like I cross seven mountains and seven seas
I still dey insist oga I no dey resist
Me I don hustle now d cash no contain my Jeans
But no be so e be yesterday
No be so e be yesterday

In the tension dem won put me under pressure
Won fe gbo nkan ti mo fe so
