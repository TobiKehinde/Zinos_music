2 ContributorsRocking Lyrics[Pre-Chorus]
Baby let’s do that thing
Maybe if you cum, you come to your senses
Organize pool party
Link me with your friends and sister the best thing
Imma do the both of you, no need to fight
Me i want to free my mind
So make you no dull the vibe
Never see a girl like you wey get design
Me i don see the sign
Man no go fit resign (Yeh)

[Chorus]
Ah, keep on popping, keep on rocking
Pasuma, keep on rocking
Me and you, we get something
Keep on popping, keep on rocking
Pasuma, keep on rocking
Me and you, we get something

[Verse 1]
Yeh
All the girls on my neck like fly
But I am sorry, I no get their time
Be like say I got them hypnotized
Upside down, you are six, I am nine
Girl just tell me if you are not coming
Baby don’t get me worried
Fuck then tell me sorry
Yeah I’m lowkey but I get money
Your ex-boyfriend gon mo mi
Keep on rocking no dulling o

Many sweet is brutal
Took a knife straight to my eye

O le pe mi loruko ko fami ni irun gbon
Bi o shen shey mi, o dun gan
Gbo gbo e lo ni tun mon
Omo let’s do more
