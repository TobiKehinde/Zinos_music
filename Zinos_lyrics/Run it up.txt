2 ContributorsRun It Up Lyrics[Intro]
All my life
I've been tryna understand
(It's Young Jonn, The Wicked Producer)

[Verse 1]
All my life
I've been tryna understand (I been tryna understand)
Why do people move like that?
I wish I fit read their mind
So if I love you, I expect you to break my heart (I expect you to break my heart)
Yeah I'm that type of guy
Been like that from the start

[Chorus]
Run it up (Run it up)
Daddy say don't fuck it up (Don't fuck it up)
Everything you do, do it small small (Do it small small)
Remember where you come from (Come from)
Turn me on (Turn me on)
Keep on going don't stop (Don't stop)
Ma bawon duro si bustop
Ko de ma fuwon je nonstop

[Verse 2]
You know I've been thinking fast in my mind
For long me I dey my grind
No salary mo den pawo
To ba pade mi, mo le yawo
Respect is reciprocal my guy
Sometimes I no dey like come online
Me and you no dey same parole
I just wanna wake up kin de kawo
